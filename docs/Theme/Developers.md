Themes are meant to change the design and UI of Archangel. Documentation for extension development is [also available](https://github.com/archangel/archangel/blob/master/docs/Extension/Developers.md).

## Generate a theme

Generate an Archangel extension with `archangel theme NAME`

To generate an extension at `PWD` with the name `archangel_foo_theme`

```
